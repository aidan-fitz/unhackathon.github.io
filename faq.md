# Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does attending cost?
It’s free! As long as you can get to the event in NYC, you don't have to pay anything.

### What should I bring with me?
Your brain, and your heart! And anything else that you need to be your most productive. Laptop, peripherals, and anything else you need to work on your project. We’ll have some hardware to hack on as well, but bring anyting you're sure you'll need.

### Should I work with a team?
It's up to you! Teams of up to 5 are allowed, pair programming is okay, and working by yourself is also okay. We will have guided springboard projects that are great for beginners and solo participants. We will also help you find a team if you want one.

### Will there be prizes?
We will not be rewarding large cash prizes as we feel these encourage unhealthy competition while detracting from our focus on learning. However, we plan to have smaller prizes in a variety of categories to encourage you to stick with your project until the end.

### Where can I get more info?
