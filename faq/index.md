# Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does attending cost?
It’s free! We don’t have exact numbers at this time, but we can say the event itself is free, and we intend to reimburse travel.

### What should I bring with me?
Your brain, and your heart! And anything else that you need to be your most productive. Laptop, peripherals, sweatshirt, change of clothes, toiletries, and a pillow and sleeping bag if you plan on napping. We’re working on getting some hardware to hack on, but you should plan on bringing anything you definitely need.

### Should I work with a team?
It's up to you! Teams of up to 5 are allowed, pair programming is okay, and working by yourself is also okay. We will have guided springboard projects that are great for beginners and solo participants. We will also help you find a team if you want one.

### Will there be prizes?
We will not be rewarding large cash prizes as we feel these encourage unhealthy competition while detracting from our focus on learning. However, we plan to have smaller prizes in a variety of categories to encourage you to stick with your project until the end.

### Where can I get more info?
