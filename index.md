title: A New Kind of Hackathon, September 5, NYC
---

We hope to encourage attendees to learn new skills and technologies by making API resources, hardware, and interesting data sets available to everyone. We’ll also have everything you’ll need to be productive - many inspiring work spaces to fit your mood, energy drinks and healthy snacks and meals, and advice from the greatest mentors ever. Our mentors come from the best NYC tech companies and startups, and will be around the whole time to help you with everything from ideas to bugs.

April’s event will take place over two days - Saturday will be an afternoon of workshops, tech talks with sponsors, and learning in preparation for creating projects. We will support hackers as they learn and experiment, getting ready to hit the ground running the next morning. Sunday will be a full day of hacking on projects, ending in demos and prizes.
