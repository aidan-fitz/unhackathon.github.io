    <h1 class="section-heading">What is Unhackathon?</h1>
    <p>When we first created Unhackathon, we wanted to make hackathons even more inclusive and fun! Our first order of business was making sure that everyone felt safe, had good food to eat, and time to sleep. We then moved onto improving awards, ensuring that they were based on technical ambition, thoughtful code, inspired design, and potential for improvements beyond the hackathon. This year, we want to go further in making the event the funnest possible for everyone involved. We want everyone, from enthusiastic beginners to grizzled coding veterans to come home with something they're proud of, and something new they've learned.</p>
    <p>We hope to encourage attendees to learn new skills and technologies by making API resources, hardware, and interesting data sets available to everyone. We’ll also have everything you’ll need to be productive - many inspiring work spaces to fit your mood, energy drinks and healthy snacks and meals, and advice from the greatest mentors ever. Our mentors come from the best NYC tech companies and startups, and will be around the whole time to help you with everything from ideas to bugs.</p>
    <p>We want our hackers to learn a ton in a short time within a welcoming environment. We place great value on diversity, of ideas and of backgrounds. Are you eager to learn something new? We would love for you to join us.</p>

    <h1 class="section-heading">Should I attend Unhackathon?</h1>
    <p>Absolutely! We want to see college students from every background, whether or not you have any programming skill. We will be judging applications primarily on thoughtfullness and enthusiasm, and not based on whether you've already written a C compiler in your spare time. But if you have accomplished everything, we'd still love you to come and help spread the hackathon cheer!</p>
    <p>Unhackathon is open to all college students. You should be interested in coding, as that is what you will be doing at Unhackathon. However, you do not need to be a skilled programmer; Unhackathon is intended to be a learning environment. You should not come to Unhackathon in search of others to do free work on your app idea, but if you'd like to give it a try coding it up yourself we'd be happy to help you out. You don't need a team to attend; we'll happily match you up with a team when you arrive and you are also welcome to work solo. We can also help you brainstorm project ideas if you don't already have one in mind.</p>
    <p>On the fence? Here are some statistics and anecdotes from last year's event:
      <ul>
        <li>Half of of our attendees were attending their first hackathon.</li>
        <li>We had more women attending than any other student hackathon we've attended. 20% of our attendees were women and we hope to improve upon this number this year.</li>
        <li>A number of attendees told us this was the "best" and/or "most welcoming" hackathon they've attended. Or that they learned more in a day at Unhackathon than they had in a semester of school.</li>
        <li>One hacker programmed a simulation of a neuron, another team created a game highlighting the hardships of being a single mother. Whatever your idea, we'd love to help your project become reality.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>We hope we've convinced you! Come with ready minds and pour your heart into creating something great.</p>
